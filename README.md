# DevRec
# A multi-objective search-based approach, named DevRec, to recommend the set of developers for a given task on crowdsourcing software development(CSD). 
## Project for the submitted paper for Empirical Software Engineering Journal.

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is twofold:

1. Data Collection: Collecting data from the crowdsourcing software development(CSD) i.e. topcoder and get features of tasks and devepoers.

2. DevRec: Apply a multi-objective search-based approach, named DevRec, to recommended the set of developers a given task on crowdsourcing software development(CSD).

## Running Experiment

## Stack
- Windows 10
- VSCode 1.45.1
- PowerShell 7.0.1
- Python 3.8.3
- JavaScript 18.12.1


The order for running the code are as follows:
1. [Data Collection](DataCollection/)
2. Data Preparation
   - [Cosine_Similarity](Cosine_Similarity/)
   - [Developer Social Network](social_network_analysis/)
3. [Developer Recommendation](DevRec/)

## Note to rerun experiment
- The "Dataset" directory is needed to be placed in the same directory as the project. The dataset is aviliable in this link Data : [The dataset and the experimental results](https://etsmtl365-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/nuri_almarimi_1_ens_etsmtl_ca/EsKNnqfI4B5NhsmsFqyig5wBuNvOlpBicQaugDCT6f6A5w?e=0kA2dl).
- Run the developer recommendation code by run the file DevRec.py.
